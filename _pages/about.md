I am a French doctor of mathematics currently working at the Institut de Mathématiques de Marseille in France where I defended my PhD thesis, done under the supervision of Bruno Torrésani. My main research areas are time-frequency and time-scale analysis. More precisely, I am currently developing nonlinear time-frequency transforms with adaptive behaviour. The purpose of these modifications is to enable the resolution of the analysis to be changed locally depending on the behaviour of the analysed signal. This is known as a 'focused transform' and is constructed using the concept of 'focus functions'. As our motivation is audio processing, we have decided that the focus should act on transient phenomena, but other phenomena can also be studied. 

As well as mathematics, I am also a live sound engineer for local bands. Most of them play metal, rock or punk, but I am open to various styles of music. I enjoy going to concerts, mixing at concerts and, more generally, listening to music and drawing links with science. I think music is a very good way to popularise it, especially when it comes to time-frequency analysis.
