I am a French doctor of mathematics currently working at the Institut de Mathématiques de Marseille in France where I defended my PhD thesis, done under the supervision of Bruno Torrésani. My main research areas are time-frequency and time-scale analysis. More precisely, I am currently developing nonlinear time-frequency transforms with adaptive behaviour. The purpose of these modifications is to enable the resolution of the analysis to be changed locally depending on the behaviour of the analysed signal. This is known as a 'focused transform' and is constructed using the concept of 'focus functions'. As our motivation is audio processing, we have decided that the focus should act on transient phenomena, but other phenomena can also be studied. 

Beside mathematics I am also live sound engineer for local bands. Most of them are either metal, rock or punk bands but I am open to various style of musics. I enjoy listening concerts, mixing concerts and drawing links with my science field. I think music is a very good way to popularise science especially time-frequency analysis.
